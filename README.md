# Interval-Timer

Coded and compiled in Xcode 11.7
May not work correctly in any version later than 11.7

This is an interval timer where you choose the number of rounds, active, and rest time in seconds

**Application is still in progress
Currently, to start a new set of rounds you must completely close the application and reopen
Will be implementing the ability to restart the timer from with the application
